## üåç UrbanPulse ‚Äì Mapping the Health of Our Cities

**UrbanPulse** is a smart data-driven web platform that transforms **NASA Earth Observation data** and **local environmental datasets** into actionable insights about the *health and sustainability* of cities. The project focuses on building a **City Health Index (0‚Äì100)** that represents a city‚Äôs overall environmental condition based on parameters like **air quality, temperature, green cover, and population density**.

The main goal of UrbanPulse is to make complex space and environmental data understandable and useful for **citizens, researchers, and urban planners**. It provides an **interactive dashboard** where users can explore live data through **maps, graphs, and charts**, helping them identify pollution hotspots, heat islands, and low-green zones. This empowers local governments and organizations to take **data-driven actions** toward building healthier urban environments.

The platform integrates data from multiple open sources such as **NASA MODIS**, **Landsat**, **Sentinel**, and **OpenAQ**, combining them with population and vegetation data to generate a detailed city profile. With tools like **Leaflet.js** for mapping and **Chart.js** for analytics, UrbanPulse ensures an engaging and easy-to-understand visualization experience. The system also includes **AI-powered recommendations**, suggesting improvements like increasing green areas or reducing traffic congestion in critical zones.

Technically, UrbanPulse is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **Node.js** for data processing, with **MongoDB Atlas** as the database. It is hosted on **Vercel/Netlify** for global accessibility.

Beyond being just a visualization tool, UrbanPulse aims to bridge the gap between **space data and sustainable urban planning**. It supports the **UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11): Sustainable Cities and Communities** by enabling smarter decision-making for environmental health.

By leveraging space-based observations and AI, UrbanPulse aspires to create a future where every city can monitor its ecological footprint, detect risks early, and work toward becoming greener and healthier ‚Äî one pulse at a time. üå±
